#AddDataToNewView

The module adds components from an existing view to an new user defined view, including new attributes. The attributes are initialized with zero. The module is also used to append a new attribute to an existing view. Therefore the output view has the same name as the input view.

The following figure shows the input dialog and an example input. Here components assigned to SuperBlock are assigned to the new created View Catchment. Also an new Attribute is Impervious is appended to the component.
