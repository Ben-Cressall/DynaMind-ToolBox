As input data for raster data and a view containing faces are required. The following figure shows the input dialog. If the data in port is connected to the data stream, a raster data set can be chosen with the Raster Data combo box. The view that contains the faces to which the new calculated attributes are added can be defined in the Append To combo box. In Name of Attribute the attribute name is defined.


You can select between sum or median values. Additional a Multiplier that is multiplied with calculated value can be defined.
