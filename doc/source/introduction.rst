Introduction

DynaMind is a light weight open source GIS workflow engine (similar ArcGIS's model builder) for
developers and researchers to build complex simulations based on rich GIS data.
Aim is to build small but reusable modules, that combined, can solve complex problems. DynaMind provides the
foundation  complex scientific simulations by providing a light weight workflow engine

(i) workflow engine
(ii) easy module development in Python or C++
(iii) number of modules ranging from import and export GIS data from a variety of sources

A workflow in DynaMind consists of reusable modules that are connected to describe complex processes.
