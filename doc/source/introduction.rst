DynaMind is a light weight open source GIS workflow/simulation engine for developers and researchers to make development and sharing of models that work with rich interlinked GIS data sets easier.

Key features of DynaMind are:

- Interactive workflow engine that allows GIS models to be combined to describe complex work flows
- Standardised and easy to use interfaces for C++ and Python to develop GIS models as DynaMind Modules that can be shared with others


The DynaMind-Toolbox ships as a ready to use environment that contains:

-  Workflow engine
-  Standard modules to import and export data from GIS databases and Shapefiles and do simple manipulations
-  Graphical user interface to build simulations
