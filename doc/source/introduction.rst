DynaMind is a light weight open source GIS workflow engine (similar ArcGIS's model builder) for
developers and researchers to make development and sharing of models that work with rich GIS data sets easier.

Key features of DynaMind are:

- an interactive workflow engine that allows GIS models to be combined to complex work flows
- standardised and easy to use interfaces for C++ and Python to develop GIS models as DynaMind Modules that can be shared with others

The DynaMind-Toolbox ships as a ready to use environment that contains:

-  Workflow engine
-  Standard modules to import and export data from GIS databases and Shapefiles and do simple manipulations
-  Graphical user interface to build simulations
