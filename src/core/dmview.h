/**
  * @class DM::View
  *
  * @brief Data in DynaMind are organised in views. A view provides a description of a
  * component and its attributes and how they are accessed in the module.
  *
  * @ingroup DynaMind-Core
  *
  *
  * A view is defined by:
  *
  * @section Type
  * Following Type are supported in DynaMind:
  *
  * -   NODE
  * -   EDGE
  * -   FACE
  * -   SUBSYSTEM
  * -   RASTERDATA
 *
  * @section AccessType
  * The AccessType defines the assecctype geometric component.
  * Following AccessTypes are supported:
  * - Read: Geometry stays the same and no new components are added to the view
  * - Write: Gemetroy of existing components can be changed and new components can be added to the view
  * - Modify: Gemeotry can be modified but no new components are added to the view
  *
  * @section Attributes
  * Every component can hold attributes. In the view the access to the attributes of the component is defined.
  * Following methods can be used to access attributes within a module
  *
  * - addAttribute(std::string name)
  * - getAttribute(std::string name)
  * - modifyAttribute(std::string name)
  *
  * @section Dummy Component
  * To every View a Dummy Component is created. The dummy component is used to track the changes made by the modules.
